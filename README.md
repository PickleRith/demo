Good day, everyone! Today's update is all about taking your autofill experience to next level when used with the latest extensions for your browsers. Previously, you had to move your cursor all the way to the Enpass icon in the browser toolbar to initiate autofill. Now, in the new extensions we've replaced this tedious process with a lightweight autofill popup menu that will appear on the web page itself with a list of suggestions to choose from.

This blazingly fast autofill experience is there for all the supported browsers, and you need to update the extensions as well.

Happy autofilling!!

What's New:

Support for Inline Autofill on browsers: Experience the new autofill using the inline popup menu, which is enabled by default and presents the logins, credit cards, and identities right there on the loaded forms on the webpage. This update has been made for all supported browsers.
Keyboard shortcuts: Additional options to set keyboard shortcuts in your browser extensions to lock, autofill, and activate Enpass. The existing shortcuts (if any) will be reset.
Code-signing certificate for executables has been updated as the current one is expiring this month. So if you get a warning message from antivirus or a Windows smart screen warning, it is due to the new code-signing certificate. Please allow the executable to run, and you should be good to go!
Fixes:

Some of you were getting a message ---This version of Enpass is out of date--- on launching the Enpass app. This has been fixed.
While importing data from 1Password, some items were missing due to the large size of the note items. This has been fixed.
Enpass was updating the password of another item with the same username. This has been fixed.
